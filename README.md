## 15 Puzzle Game
This is a simple Java program implementing the classic 15 Puzzle game. The project was inspired by my experiences in class and during my previous project involving Sudoku. I remember playing the 15 Puzzle game as a child, so I decided to apply my Swing and Java skills to create this version.

### Features
Implemented using Java Swing for the graphical interface and linked lists for game functionality, this project is designed to be a fun and engaging endeavor. All the game logic is original, showcasing my coding prowess in implementing the intricate mechanics of Sudoku, even though I understood the game's principles beforehand.
### How to Play
Launch the game.
Click on the "Random" button to shuffle the tiles.
Click on tiles adjacent to the empty space to move them.
Rearrange the tiles to solve the puzzle.
### Future Updates
I plan to continue working on this project, making incremental improvements and adding new features over time. This includes refining the user interface, optimizing the game logic, and incorporating user feedback. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
